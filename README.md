# S

_Get strong typed, autocompleted resources like images, fonts and colors in Swift projects_

**S** is inspired (and complementary) to **R**.
It generates swift code from a **YAML** stylesheet. 

This:

```yaml

Color:
  red:
    "horizontal = compact and idiom = phone": "#aa0000"
    "default": "#ff0000"
  blue: "#00ff00"

Typography:
  small: Font("Helvetica", 12)
  
FooView:
  background: $Color.red
  font: $Typography.small
  defaultMargin: 10

```

is transformed into a strongly typed, stylesheet in swift

```swift 

///Entry point for the app stylesheet
struct S {

	static let FooView = FooViewStyle()
	class FooViewStyle {
		var background: UIColor { return Color.red  }
		var font: UIFont { return Typography.small }
		let defaultMargin: CGFloat = 10 
	}
    
	static let Color = ColorStyle()
	class ColorStyle {

		let blue = UIColor(red: 0.0, green: 1.0, blue: 0.0)
		var red: UIColor { return self.redWithTraitCollection() }

		func redWithTraitCollection(trait: UITraitCollection? = UIScreen.mainScreen().traitCollection) -> UIColor {
			let device = UIDevice.currentDevice()
			if device.userInterfaceIdiom == .Phone  && trait?.horizontalSizeClass == .Compact {
             	return UIColor(red: 0.8, green: 0, blue: 0)
            	}
			return UIColor(red: 1, green: 0, blue: 0)
		}
	}
    
	static let Typography = TypographyStyle()
	class TypographyStyle {
		let small = UIFont(name: "Helvetica", size: 12.0)!
	}
}

```
And you can access to it by simply typing  `S.Color.red` 

The stylesheet supports colors (with some helper function like darken, lighten, gradient), fonts, images, metrics and bools.


Like in the example it supports complex conditions for the value that take the screen size, the size class and the user interaction idiom into account.
(`S.Color.red` could be a different value given a different screen size/size class/idiom). See the stylesheet section for more info about it.


## Installation
One line installation.
Copy and paste this in your terminal.

```
git clone https://github.com/alexdrone/S.git && cd S && cp sgen /usr/local/bin/sgen && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/sgen
```

The usage of the generator is as simple as 
```
sgen $SRCROOT
```

## Adding S as a build script

You can integrate **S** in your build pashes by adding it as a build script.

- Click on your **TARGET** abd go the **Build Phases** tab.
- Click on the **+** and select **New Run Script Phase**

- Expand the **Run script** section
- Add `sgen $SRCROOT` in the script

![GitHub Logo](Doc/screen_2.jpg)

- Now you can create your `.yaml` stylesheet. Make sure it is placed inside your project source root (`$SRCROOT`)

- The first time you build your target (with `cmd + B`) you need to drag the generated file inside the project. The generated swift file sits next to your stylesheet so, simply right click on your yaml stylesheet and select **Show in Finder** and drag the  `*.generated.swift` file inside your project

- Et voil√†! Every time you will build your target the generated file will be updated as well.
